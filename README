What is dns_cached?

It replaces daemontools so you can run djbdns' dnscache without installing daemontools


Why would you do that?

I wanted a lightweight dns resolver for my laptop so that I wasn't at the mercy
of some dhcp-assigned DNS server.

djbdns http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html seemed to be the solution, however DJB
intended it to run under daemontools, and I didn't want that on my laptop.


What about IPv6? 

Add the IPv6 patch from http://www.fefe.de/dns/
